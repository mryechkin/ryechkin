## Brief history

For most of its life, the web had only one way to load script files - via plain `<script>` tags:

```jsx
<script src="hi.js"></script>
<script src="hello.js"></script>
```

This is now what we refer to as **classic** scripts.

### Classic Scripts

Characteristics of classic scripts:

- Shared scope (global)
- No explicit way to specify dependency between files
- Order of `<script>` tags matters
- Gets really messy, really quickly

## Tooling to the rescue!

- Tools started to emerge to help solve those problems
- Bundlers like **Webpack**, **Rollup**, **Parcel**, **Rome**, **esbuild**, etc.
- Generate the final app bundle, and allow us to use JS **modules**

## What are modules anyway?

Modules are a way to organize code in JavaScript.
They let us write code in one JavaScript file, that explicitly
depends on (or is a dependency of) code in another file.

## Why bundling?

In high-latency environments (like the browser), it's faster to send one large file, rather than many small ones.
But more importantly, bundling enables us to utilize JavaScript **modules** in our code.

## Module Resolution

When browsers / Node load modules, they build a "map" of all the modules that are used in the code.
This is what's often referred to as a **module graph**

## Module Specifiers

Modules are loaded using keywords like `import` and `require`:

```js
import { something } from './module.js';
```

```js
const something = require('./module');
```

These are called **module specifiers**. Some differences exist, depending on the module format.

Module specifiers can be either full or relative URL's:

```js
import { something } from './module.js';
```

```js
import { other } from 'https://some.cdn.com/some/module.js';
```

And they can also be "bare" (ie. without extension):

```js
import { something } from 'module';
```

**NOTE:** this is not yet supported in browsers

## Module Scope

The way modules are loaded is different between browsers and server environment (ie. Node).

Browsers load modules as **stateful singletons** - meaning that the same module will share its state anywhere it's imported in the application for that session.

In a Node environment, however, modules are loaded as **instances** - and as such, each instance has its own state, not shared with any of the other instances of the same module.

## Module Formats

There are several different module formats:

- **ES Module** (ESM)
- **CommonJS** (CJS)
- **AMD**
- **UMD**
- **System**

## Why so many?

- Different JavaScript runtime environments (browser vs Node)
- No single standard for a long time
- Concurrent attempts at solving the problem (even JS standards are async.. how meta!)
- Now standardized by **TC39** (by way of ES Modules)

## ES Modules (ESM)

ES Modules is the standard established and governed by the **TC39** committee

```js
import something, { another } from 'some-thing';
```

- The modern standard for JS modules going forward
- Supported by major browsers
- Uses `.js` and `.mjs` extensions
- Uses `import` and `export` keywords
- Exposes either "default" or "named" exports
- Code can be statically analyzed and "tree-shaken"

Characteristics of `ESM`:

- `import`'s are static and async (expose variable bindings)
- `import`'s must live at the root level
- `import` specifier can take in only a string literal
- `import`'s also get hoisted, so can be written anywhere in the code

To load an ES Module in a browser, need to specify `type` as `"module"` in the script tag:

```jsx
<script type="module" src="/some-module.js"></script>
```

When loading in Node, there are several ways:

- Set `type` field to `"module"` in the `package.json` of the project
- Using the `.mjs` extension
- Using `--input-type=module` flag in command-line

## CommonJS (CJS)

CommonJS is a module system used in **Node.js**

```js
const something = require('some-thing');
```

- Established standard in server (Node) environment
- Uses `require` and `module.exports` keywords
- Uses `.js` or `.cjs` file extensions
- Cannot be loaded directly in browsers
- Tools exist to be able to run CJS modules in browsers (eg. `browserify`)
- Slowly starting to get replaced by ESM

Characteristics of `CJS`:

- Modules are loaded dynamically (ie. at runtime)
- Module specifier is a function call (`require(...)`) and is synchronous (ie. blocking)
- `require()` can take take in JS expressions (ie. it's dynamic)
- Doesn't know what's going to be loaded ahead of time (since `require()` is dynamic)
- Module resolution is synchronous
- Exposes object `module.exports`

## Interoperability

With all the differences between the module formats we've seen so far (and we've only covered 2), and the different environments they can be used,
it's evident why there is such a strong need for a **single** uniform module specification.

**What happens if you want to use a CJS module inside an ESM one? Or the other way around?**

Natively, you can't. Bundlers and transpilers such as **Babel**, **Webpack**, **Rollup** etc. have been doing a decent job of ensuring compatibility
between the different formats and runtimes, however some [edge cases](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/481) and [issues](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/12363) still exist.

It's a problem that will be there for some time still, until all the different JavaScript environments align to each other.

**Why is it difficult to move away from CommonJS?**

- It's everywhere
- Main format used in Node
- Node only recently started supporting ES Modules (as of `13.2.0`)
- Lots of large codebases and tools still using it

## Tree Shaking

_"Tree-shaking"_ or what is also known as _"dead code elimination"_ is a process through which tools such as **Webpack** and **Rollup** do
static analysis of your code, and try to determine which modules aren't utilized.

Doing this allows us to drastically cut down on the overall bundle size, and only include what's actually needed to run the app / library

**ES Modules** are much more compatible with this process. How you structure your exports also plays a big role in whether a module can be tree-shaken or not.
