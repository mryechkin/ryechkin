In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and the technical product owner of an internal component library for React. I work with a team of talented engineers and designers to establish an end-to-end design system at Manulife. Together, we strive to provide our developers with an exceptional developer experience through a collection of modern libraries, tools and technologies.

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering** at **Carleton University**, but my focus and passion have always been in web technologies. I've been developing enterprise-grade software for over 12 years now.
