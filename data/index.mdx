I'm a lead front-end software engineer based in **Kitchener, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦<br />
I write code for a living, drink more coffee than I probably should, and listen to a lot of electronic music in the process <RickRoll />

I've been doing web development for **12+ years**, with focus on **JavaScript** and **React** for nearly half that time. Currently I'm leading the team building a front-end tooling and component library ecosystem for a **design system** at Manulife.
