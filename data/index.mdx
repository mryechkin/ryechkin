I'm a lead front-end software engineer based in **Kitchener, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦<br />
I write code for a living, drink more coffee than I probably should, and listen to a lot of
electronic music in the process <RickRoll />

I've been doing web development for over **12 years** now, with focus mostly on **JavaScript**
and **React**. Currently I'm leading the team building a front-end tooling and component
library ecosystem for the **design system** at Manulife.
