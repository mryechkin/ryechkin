## Intro

If you've done web development for any amount of time, there's a good chance you've had to work with tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) and other front-end tooling systems. But do you know why we started using them in the first place, and why they are still part of our everyday workflow?

In this post, we'll take a look at one of the core areas of JavaScript - the **module ecosystem** - and why tools like the ones mentioned above are _required_ (ü•Å).

## Overview

Before we talk about what modules are, let's take a brief look at some JavaScript history, and why modules and their different formats came to be.

For most of its early life, "the web" (ie. browsers) had only one way to load script files, via plain `<script>` tags:

```html
<head>
  <script src="a.js"></script>
  <script src="b.js"></script>
  <script src="c.js"></script>
</head>
```

This is now what we refer to as "classic" scripts. In classic scripts, all [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) is shared (via the global `window` object). There is also no explicit way to specify dependency between files, so order of `<script>` tags matters. You need to be careful about the order in which files are imported, and be mindful of subsequent changes in them.

This may not be such a big deal for simple scripts and adding some interactivity to a static page, but nowadays we run entire applications comprised of complex JavaScript - and as you can imagine, with the classic scripts approach things can get really messy, really quickly. There had to be another - better - way of loading JavaScript.

With the advent of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) in 2009, we also needed a way to load and run JavaScript on the server as well. With one key difference, however. In high-latency client environments like the browser, it's faster to send one large file, rather than many small ones. By contrast, in a server environment files are co-located on the same filesystem, and as such can be accessed virtually instantly. Node can load as many individual files as necessary, without any performance implications due to latency.

And this is where the module system and JavaScript tooling come into play.

## So what are modules anyway?

Modules are a mechanism for splitting up JavaScript into smaller, manageable logical chunks of code. They are essentially a way to organize, and ship code in JavaScript. Modules let us write code in one file that explicitly depends on (or is a dependency of) code in another file.

When browsers and Node load a JavaScript program, they build a map of all the modules that are used in the project. This process is called **module resolution**, and the map of these modules and their relationship to each other is often referred to as a **module graph**. The resolution algorithm itself is different depending on the runtime environment.

### Module Formats

There are several different module formats: [ES6 Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) (or **ESM**), [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) (or **CJS**), [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) and [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) are among the ones you're likely to come across.

**Why so many?**

As mentioned earlier, there are different JavaScript runtime environments to consider. We have the **browser** with its various implementations (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), and then the **server**, with runtimes like [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/). Each has its own different set of concerns, as we saw earlier as well.

That made it tricky to land on a specification. For a long time, there wasn't a single, agreed-upon standard between those environments in terms of how to deal with modules. There were concurrent attempts at solving the problem (even JavaScript standards themselves are _async_ ü•Å), and what resulted was an emergence of the module formats mentioned above.

Eventually, module format spec was standardized by the [TC39](https://tc39.es/) committee, with **ESM** becoming the de-facto "future-proof" standard going forward. Along with **CommonJS**, it is the format you are most likely to come across and work with today.

### Module Specifiers

Modules are loaded using keywords like `import`:

```js
import user from './module.js';
```

and `require`:

```js
const user = require('./module');
```

These are called **module specifiers**. They can be either full or relative URL's:

```js
// Full URL
import { greet } from 'https://some.cdn.com/module.js';

// Relative URL
import { greet } from './module.js';
```

They can also be "bare" (ie. without specifying file extensions):

```js
import { greet } from './module';
```

**NOTE:** the bare specifier is not yet supported in browsers as of the writing of this post, and requires tools to interpret the syntax.

### Module Scope

The way modules are loaded is different between browsers and server environments (ie. Node).

Browser loads modules as **stateful singletons** - meaning that the same module will share its state anywhere it's imported in the application, for the duration of that session. A good mental model to help understand this better is:

> **"When you import a module, you're not getting a piece of code that you're running, you get a reference to an object in memory"**

(shoutout to [Sam Selikoff](https://twitter.com/samselikoff) and [Ryan Toronto](https//twitter.com/ryanto) from [Frontend First Podcast](https://frontendfirst.fm/) whose discussion in [Episode #100](https://youtu.be/j1s_3zytAcM?t=1740) helped a great deal in understanding these concepts)

In a Node environment, however, modules are loaded as **instances**. This means that each imported module instance in your app has its own state, not shared with any of the other instances of the same module - so you no longer have a **global** module state.

### Module Exports

By default, everything that is declared inside a module is scoped locally to that module. If you want to make something accessible outside the module (and really, that's the whole point), you need to `export` it. There are several ways of exporting, and which one to use will depend on the target module format (ie. ESM vs CommonJS), as well as what kind of export you are doing.

In general, ES modules have two types of exports: **default** and **named**. You can export any top-level function, class or variable.

**When to use which?**

That really depends on the intended use and structure of the module. One approach is to `export default` the main functionality of a module, to denote its main intent. Then any supplemental functionality or data are treated as named exports.

## Format: ES6 Modules (ESM)

**ESM** is the standard established and governed by [TC39](https://tc39.es/) committee. It is the modern standard for JavaScript modules going forward, and is supported natively in all major browsers, as well as newer versions of Node (15 and above). For Node 14 and below, ESM can be enabled with the help of 3rd party libraries (eg. [esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm)).

ESM uses `.js` and `.mjs` extensions (browser and Node, respectively), and utilizes `import` keyword for importing, and `export` for exporting.

When exporting from ESM, you can do either **default** or **named** exports:

```js:module.esm.js
const user = { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' };

// named exports
export const GREETING = 'Hello';

export function greet(greeting, user) {
  return `${greeting}, ${user.name} from ${user.location}`;
}

// default export
export default user;
```

Importing can be done using **default** imports:

```js:index.js
import user from './module.js';
```

or using **named** imports, where the name of the thing you're importing goes inside curly braces:

```js:index.js
import { greet } from './module.js';
```

You can also import both default and named at the same time, as well as multiple named imports, using this one-line convention:

```js:index.js
import user, { greet, GREETING } from './foo.js';

console.log(greet(GREETING, user)); // "Hello, Human from Planet Earth"

console.log(GREETING); // "Hello"
console.log(user); // { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' }
```

Some characteristics and rules of ESM:

- `import`'s are static and asynchronous (browsers are async in their nature, after all)
- `import`'s must live at the root level
- `import`'s also get hoisted, so can be written anywhere in the code
- `import` specifier can only accept a string literal (ie. it can't be dynamically generated)

Due to this nature of ESM, code written in it can also be statically analyzed and **tree-shaken** by tools like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) , so that no extra unused JavaScript is included in the bundle.

> **"Tree-shaking"** or what is also known as "dead code elimination" is a process through which tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) do static analysis of your code, and try to determine which modules aren't utilized. Doing this allows these tools to drastically cut down on the overall bundle size, and only include what's actually needed to run your application or library code. ESM is much more compatible with this process.

To load an ESM module in a browser, we need to specify `type` as `"module"` in the script tag:

```jsx
<script type="module" src="/some-module.js"></script>
```

When loading in Node, there are several ways to target ESM:

- Set `type` field to `"module"` in the `package.json` of the project
- Use the `.mjs` file extension
- Using `--input-type=module` flag via Node CLI

## Format: CommonJS (CJS)

CommonJS (or **CJS**) is a module system that originated in [Node](https://nodejs.org/). It has been the prevalent format in the Node ecosystem for many years, and is still used in many libraries and tools today.

CJS modules are exported via `module.exports`, and use the `require` keyword for importing:

```js:module.cjs.js
const user = { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' };

const GREETING = 'Hello';

const greet = (greeting, user) => `${greeting}, ${user.name} from ${user.location}`;

module.exports = { greet, GREETING };

module.exports.default = user;
```

Note that the above can also be written this way:

```js
module.exports.greet = greet;
module.exports.GREETING = GREETING;
module.exports.default = user;
```

To import CommonJS, use the `require` keyword :

```js:index.js
const { default: user, greet, GREETING } = require('./module.js');
console.log(greet(GREETING, user)); // "Hello, Human from Planet Earth"
console.log(GREETING); // "Hello"
console.log(user); // { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' }
```

CommonJS uses `.js` and `.cjs` file extensions, and it _cannot_ be loaded directly in a browser. For that exist specific tools that allow us to run CommonJS code in a browser environment, such as [Browserify](https://browserify.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and others.

Unlike ES6 Modules which are loaded **asynchronously**, CommonJS module resolution is **synchronous**. Remember how we talked about server environments having virtually no latency for module loading? This is why.

Due to this low latency, CJS modules are loaded dynamically, at runtime. The module specifier is a function, which can accept JS expressions, making `require` dynamic. This allows us to do things like conditional imports:

```js
const { thing } = require(isTrue ? './a.js' : './b.js');
```

However, this has certain tradeoffs. For instance, JavaScript tools can't know what's going to be loaded ahead of time. This unfortunately makes CommonJS modules not compatible with tree-shaking. It's much less of a concern on the server - since you're not sending code to the client - and if we rememeber that the CJS module format originated in Node, then it make sense why this format wouldn't concern itself with that.

## Interoperability

With all the differences between the module formats we've seen so far, and the different runtime environment gotchas, it's evident why there is such a strong need for a **single**, standard module specification going into the future.

Now let us ask a question:

**"What happens if you want to use a CommonJS module inside an ES6 module? Or the other way around?"**

The short answer is, it depends. Browsers don't support this natively - so we have to yet again rely on our tooling to support this functionality.

Bundlers and transpilers such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) etc. have been doing a decent job of ensuring compatibility between the different module formats and runtimes, however some [edge cases](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/481) and [issues](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/12363) still exist today.

We'll take a closer look at some of these interoperability concerns in a future post.

## Closing Thoughts

Before wrapping this up, let's consider something for a second. If there are so many issues with interoperability, then **why are we still using CommonJS?**

The answer to that is not a simple one, unfortunately. First, CommonJS is _everywhere_. It's still the main format used in Node, and has been for many years (Node only recently started supporting ESM). The NPM ecosystem is _huge_. And though many popular library authors have been shipping both ESM and CJS compatible code, there are still many packages out there that are exclusively CommonJS. This is especially true for legacy systems, and enterprise code, which may not have the luxury of moving its entire codebase to an entirely different module system.

Second, it's a lengthy process. Lots of large (and popular) codebases and tools still use and heavily rely on it. So while the goal may be to move to a single unified format down the road (ESM), it is not an overnight change, and will take some time for the entire ecosystem to migrate to it.

There are some folks who are eager to help [move it forward](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c), though others are [against the idea](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/bca2fda868c1e8b2c2caf76af7dfcad3) altogether. Both sides present valuable arguments, and the discussions are worth checking out if you're interested in the topic.

In a future post, we'll take a look at how to ship your library code in both ESM and CommonJS using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).

Until next time!

## TODO:

- Use of `esm` to import ESM in CJS (provide an example)

## Things to cover

- Brief history / why bundling
- Dependency resolution / graph
- `import` = static (expose variable bindings) and async
- `require` = dynamic (function call, expose object `module.exports`) and sync
- `import`'s must live at the root level
- `import`'s also get hoisted, so can be written anywhere in the code (as long as they're at root level)
- `require` on the other hand is resolved at runtime, which means that it's only evaluated in the place in code where it's called (this is also why it can be called conditionally)
- `import` can take in only a string literal, whereas `require` accepts any JS expression
- CommonJS doesn't know what's going to be loaded ahead of time (since `require` is dynamic)
- With ESM you can statically analyze and tree-shake code

- With classic scripts (ie. `<script src="app.js" />`) everything is in the global context (`window` object)
- IIFE's were the first attempt to modularize JS code (vars declared within a function are scoped to that function)
- Tools exist to run CommonJS modules in browsers (ex. `browserify`), which make it behave the same way they do in Node

## Why is it difficult to move away from CommonJS?

- Node was built on it
- It's everywhere
- Lots of large codebases still using it

### ESM that was transpiled to CJS

> The problem here is to maintain isomorphic behaviour between the original ES module and the CJS module. Named exports are handled mostly correctly when using the "NodeJS with named imports" pattern (except we do not throw for missing exports) however the default export should not be `module.exports` but `module.exports.default`. This is incompatible with the previously listed interop patterns.
>
> At the moment most tools implement a runtime detection pattern for this by adding an `__esModule` property to `module.exports` to signify this is a transpiled ES module. Then the algorithm when getting the default import is
>
> - If this property is present, use `module.exports.default` as the default export
> - Otherwise use `module.exports`

**NOTE:** If the entry point doesn't contain any hint it's a compiled ES module, it gets imported as a normal CommonJS module, which doesn't have a default export.

## Talking Points

## Issue with MUX bundle

The root of the problem in issue [#2071](https://github.com/manulife-innersource/mux-core/issues/2071) was that `prop-types` was not included in the list of `peerDependencies` in `package.json`, even though it is used internally by the library (meaning that MUX needs that lib to be present in `node_modules` to work properly).

In our Rollup config, we specify a list of `external` modules by pulling the names from `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` in `package.json`, which tells Rollup to not transform any of those modules and not include them in our final bundle. But as I mentioned above, `prop-types` was not included in that list. So, Rollup assumed that the code for `prop-types` needed to be included in the bundle, and would run it through the list of plugins, which includes `@rollup/plugin-commonjs`. This plugin takes CommonJS code and transforms into ES Module format, so that it can be included in the bundle. Problem with this, however, is that we don't need this to happen. The `prop-types` library is already published in the correct format, so there is no need to do this within our bundle (and include it, additionally). By doing that, we are introducing a potential for errors to happen. Which is exactly what happened with this issue.

The particular of what exactly happened are the follows:

- the `prop-types` package wasn't marked as "external", thus being included in the bundle (and as such, having the transformations applied)
- we have `exports: "named"` option set in Rollup config, since all of MUX modules are named exports (by design)
- however, this didn't take into account the presence of `prop-types` in that list, which is a CommonJS module (since that's what it's published as)
- when `output.exports` is set to `"named"`, Rollup creates a CommonJS module where the exports are an object with the `default` property

**(README.md from the `module` repo below):**

## JavaScript Modules

If you're doing web development today, you've probably heard of tools like Browserify, Webpack, [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) (and more recently esbuild and Rome). And if you haven't, it's almost guaranteed that you've at least used them (knowingly or not) as part of your favourite development toolkit.

We use these tools on the daily basis, but do we even know why? In this post, we will take a look at some of the core concepts and behaviour of modules in JavaScript, and why tools like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) are _required_ :insert-dad-joke-here:

## Module Scope

The way modules are loaded is different between browsers and server environments (ie. Node).

Browser loads modules as "stateful singletons" - meaning that the same module will share its state anywhere it's imported in the application, for the duration of that session.

A good mental model to help understand this better is:

> "When you import a module, you're not getting a piece of code that you're running, you get a reference to an object in memory".

(from [Frontend First Podcast Episode #100](https://youtu.be/j1s_3zytAcM?t=1740) with [Sam Selikoff](https://twitter.com/samselikoff) and [Ryan Toronto](https//twitter.com/ryanto) - their discussion helped a great deal in understanding these concepts, highly recommend a listen!)

In a Node environment, however, modules are loaded as instances - and as such, each instance has its own state, not shared with any of the other instances of the same module.

## Interoperability

Before we continue with the rest of the configuration, let's talk about an important concept - the concept of "interoperability".

To illustrate this, let's say we want to bundle the following code, and target a CommonJS environment (or `cjs`, as we'll see below):

```js
import external_default, * as external from 'external';
console.log(external_default, external.namedExport, external);
```

It's important to note that for tools like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), the following:

```js
import * as external from 'external';
console.log(external.namedExport);
```

is completely equivalent to

```js
import { namedExport } from 'external';
console.log(namedExport);
```

and will produce the same code. In the example above however, the namespace object itself is passed to a global function as well, which means we need it as a properly formed object.

The problem happens when `node_modules/zapatos/db.mjs` (an ESM file) imports `node_modules/zapatos/db.js` (a CommonJS file). I think the underlying issue is #532, which is already tracked. Basically there are two conflicting approaches for handling importing a CommonJS file into an ESM file. Some JavaScript tools do this one way and other JavaScript tools do this another way. It's a big mess.

The way node works is that the default export is always equal to the value of the CommonJS file's module.exports property without any exceptions. Some other JavaScript tools (but not node) support CommonJS files that have been converted from ESM format to CommonJS format. These ones are marked by setting module.`exports.__esModule` to true. For these modules, all properties on module.exports behave like named exports as if the file was in ESM format. And if there is no module.exports.default property, then there is no export named default.

So this should be considered a bug in esbuild in that the behavior isn't matching node. But it's not super straightforward to fix this because a trivial fix would break esbuild's ESM-to-CommonJS transform which esbuild relies on internally. Webpack has an approach where they try to support both of these behaviors and use heuristics to determine which approach to apply when. I assume esbuild will have to do something like that.

## Notes

- `import` = static (expose variable bindings) and async
- `require` = dynamic (function call, expose object `module.exports`) and sync
- `import`'s must live at the root level
- `import`'s also get hoisted, so can be written anywhere in the code (as long as they're at root level)
- `require` on the other hand is resolved at runtime, which means that it's only evaluated in the place in code where it's called (this is also why it can be called conditionally)
- `import` can take in only a string literal, whereas `require` accepts any JS expression
- CommonJS doesn't know what's going to be loaded ahead of time (since `require` is dynamic)
- With ESM you can statically analyze and tree-shake code

- With classic scripts (ie. `<script src="app.js" />`) everything is in the global context (`window` object)
- IIFE's were the first attempt to modularize JS code (vars declared within a function are scoped to that function)
- Tools exist to run CommonJS modules in browsers (ex. `browserify`), which make it behave the same way they do in Node

## Demo

With the above in mind, let's take a look at some examples to help us wrap our heads around the above a bit more.

We'll run a few simple examples of typical module usage, in both ESM and CommonJS contexts, using **Node 16** (`16.13.2`) runtime.

There are two ways in Node to run code as either ESM or CJS:

1. Specifying `type` field in `package.json` as either `module` (for ESM), or `commonjs` (for CJS), and keeping file extensions as `.js`
2. Setting file extension to `.mjs` for ESM, and `.js` for CJS modules, and omitting `type` field in `package.json` altogether (Node will run `.mjs` files as ES Modules)

Either method works. Let's get started!

First, let's create a folder for our project, and initialize it with NPM:

```bash
$ mkdir modules-example
$ npm init -y
```

Then in the root of the project, create a folder `src` and a simple `lib` module. Note that we will have both CommonJS and ES Module formats for demonstration purposes, denoted by `cjs` and `esm` in the filesnames respectively.

**CommonJS (CJS):**

```js
// src/lib.cjs.js
const user = { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' };

const greet = () => `Hello, ${user.name} from ${user.location}!`;

module.exports = { user, greet };
```

Alternatively, you could also write the above as:

```js
// src/lib.cjs.js
exports.user = { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' };
exports.greet = () => `Hello, ${user.name} from ${user.location}!`;
```

**ES Module (ESM):**

```js
// src/lib.esm.js
const user = { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' };

const greet = () => `Hello, ${user.name} from ${user.location}!`;

export default { user, greet };
```

Next, let's create the main `index.js` file. This will essentially be our "app" where we'll import the `lib` module. We'll take a look at the different ways the two formats behave, depending on what environment you're running in.

### ESM in ESM

For the first example, we will import the default export from the ESM `lib` module:

```js
// src/index.js
import lib from './lib.esm.js'; // ESM

console.log(lib);
```

Make sure that `type="module"` is set in your `package.json`, and then run:

```bash
$ node src/index.js
```

We'll get the following output:

```bash
{
  user: { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' },
  greet: [Function: greet]
}
```

Now, change the import to use the CJS format instead:

```js
// src/index.js
import lib from './lib.cjs.js'; // CommonJS
```

Runnng it again, we now get an error:

```bash
import lib from './lib.cjs.js';
       ^^^^
SyntaxError: The requested module './lib.cjs.js' does not provide an export named 'default'
```

Now, this happens because CommonJS doesn't have a concept of a "default" export, unlike ES Modules. To circumvent this, we'll need to import the entire namespace:

```js
// src/index.js
import * as lib from './lib.cjs.js';
```

But.. not so fast! If you try to run that now, you will get a new error:

```bash
module.exports = { user, greet };
^

ReferenceError: module is not defined
```

Node tries to import `lib.cjs.js` (which is a CommonJS module) while itself running in "module" mode (set via `package.json`). So, we need to tell Node to run in CJS mode by setting type to `"commonjs"` in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "commonjs"
}
```

We will also need to use the `require` keyword for our imports now, as we are running using CommonJS module system:

```js
// src/index.js
const lib = require('./lib.cjs.js');
```

And now, our output is as expected:

```bash
{
  user: { name: 'Human', location: 'Planet Earth' },
  greet: [Function: greet]
}
```

So that's great, but now we need to maintain two separate copies of our code - one in ESM format, and the other in CJS - not to mention having to write completely different import syntax depending on which package we're importing.

Wouldn't it be so much better if we could just write our code in our preferred format, and then have something generate the other missing format(s) for us?

This is where **Rollup** comes into play.

## Rollup

Rollup is a JavaScript module bundler. In this example, we will use it to bundle our source code, and make it compatible with all JS runtimes.

### Installation

First, you will need to install Rollup and some plugins:

```bash
$ npm i -D rollup @rollup/plugin-commonjs
```

Then, let's add a script in our `package.json` to run Rollup:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  }
}
```

This will run Rollup using the default config option, which uses `rollup.config.js` file by default. Let's create that next.

### Configuration

Rollup options can be specified via CLI, but it's much better to set those via the `rollup.config.js` file. Let's go ahead and create that in the root of our project, and set some configuration options:

```js
// rollup.config.js
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: [
    {
      file: 'dist/index.cjs.js',
      format: 'cjs',
    },
    {
      file: 'dist/index.esm.js',
      format: 'esm',
    },
  ],
  plugins: [commonjs()],
};
```

Now, if we run the build: `npm run build`, we'll see that there is a new folder created called `dist`, with two folders within it: `cjs` and `esm`. These two folders contain output from Rollup, which is our compiled code for CommonJS and ES Module environments, respectively.

Now, if we update our `index.js` to point to this newly generated code:

```js
// src/index.js
import lib from '../dist/esm/lib.cjs.js';
```

and run it again, we get the same output as before (using the original ESM file):

```
{
  user: { name: 'World', location: 'Planet Earth' },
  greet: [Function: greet]
}
```
