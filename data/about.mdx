I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering**, but my passion has always been in web technologies.
Most recently, my focus has been in **design systems** space.
I've been developing enterprise-grade software for over 12 years now.

In my current role as a **lead software engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and technical product owner of an internal component library for **React**.
I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help deliver delightful user experiences across a number of digital Manulife products.
