My name is **Mykhaylo** (like "Kylo"). I'm a software engineer based in <span className="whitespace-nowrap">Kitchener, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</span>

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years now, with focus mainly on JavaScript and React. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web development and its technologies.
Most recently, I've been focusing on **design systems** space and building accessible component libraries in React.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at [Manulife](https://www.manulife.ca), I'm the product owner and one of the core maintainers of the React implementation of the design system at Manulife. I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help our colleagues build delightful, modern user experiences across a variety of digital products.

Some of the technologies I've recently been working with include:
