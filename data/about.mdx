My name is <span className="accent font-extrabold">Mykhaylo</span> (or <span className="accent font-extrabold">Misha</span> for short), and I'm a **Front-End (UI) Engineer**.

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering**, but my passion has always been in web technologies.

Most recently, my focus has been in **design systems** space.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and technical product owner of an internal component library for **React**.
I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help deliver delightful user experiences across a number of digital Manulife products.
