title: 'About Me'
---

I also go by <span className="accent font-extrabold">Misha</span>.
I'm a software engineer based in **Kitchener, Canada**. I write code for a living, drink more coffee than I probably should, and listen to a lot of electronic music in the process <RickRoll />

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering** at **Carleton University**, but my focus and passion have always been in web technologies. I've been developing enterprise-grade software for over 12 years now.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and the technical product owner of an internal component library for React. I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to establish an end-to-end design system at Manulife. Together, we strive to provide an exceptional developer experience through a set of modern libraries, tools and technologies.
