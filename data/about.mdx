My name is <span className="accent">Mykhaylo</span> (like "Kylo"). I'm a software engineer based in <span className="whitespace-nowrap">**Kitchener, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</span>

I've been doing web development for over <span className="accent">{experience}</span> years now, with focus mainly on JavaScript and React. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web development and the technologies surrounding it.

In my current role as a <span className="accent">Lead Software Engineer</span> at [Manulife](https://www.manulife.ca), I'm the product owner and one of the core maintainers of the React implementation of the design system at Manulife. I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help our colleagues build delightful, modern user experiences across a variety of digital products.

Some of the technologies I've recently been working with include:
