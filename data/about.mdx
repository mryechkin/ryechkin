My name is <span className="accent">Mykhaylo</span> (like **"Kylo"**). I'm a software engineer based in **Kitchener, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I've been doing web development for over **12 years** now, with focus mainly on **JavaScript** and **React**. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web development and the technologies surrounding it.

I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help our colleagues build delightful, modern user experiences across a variety of digital products.

Some of the technologies I've recently been working with include:
