<hr />

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering**, but my passion was always in web technologies, in particular the front-end.
Most recently, my focus has been in **design systems** space.

In my current role as a **lead software engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and technical product owner of an internal component library for **React**.
I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help deliver delightful user experiences across a number of digital Manulife products.
