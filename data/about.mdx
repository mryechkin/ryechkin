title: 'About Me'
---

I also go by <span className="accent font-extrabold">Misha</span>.
I'm a lead software engineer at **Manulife** in **Canada**. I write code for a living, drink more coffee than I probably should, and listen to a lot of electronic music in the process <RickRoll />

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering**, but my passion has always been in web technologies.
Most recently, my focus has been in **design systems** space.
I've been developing enterprise-grade software for over 12 years now.

In my current role, I'm a core maintainer and technical product owner of an internal component library for React.
I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help deliver delightful user experiences across a number of digital Manulife products.
