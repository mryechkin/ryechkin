My name is <span className="accent font-extrabold">Mykhaylo</span> (like "Kylo"). I also sometimes go by <span className="accent font-extrabold">Misha</span>. I'm a **Front-End Software Engineer** based in **Ontario, Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I originally studied **Telecommunications Engineering**, but my passion has always been in web technologies. Most recently, my focus has been in **design systems** space and building **component libraries**.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I'm a core maintainer and technical product owner of a collection of internal component libraries for **React**.
I work with a team of talented software engineers and designers to help build delightful user experiences across a number of digital products.
