## Overview

If you're working with [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) on a regular basis, there are a few tools at your disposal that can help streamline some of the code authoring workflow.

## The Problem

One argument you often hear from opponents of Tailwind CSS is how unreadable it makes your page markup, and in particular the `class` attribute.

With long strings of numerous Tailwind classes and all sorts of possible combinations, it's understandable how that can become a bit daunting.

But, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't have to be!

## The Solution

In this article we'll take a look at how tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) can help us never have to think about class names again, and provide some helpful guidance along the way.

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is a **code linter**. Linters helps identify issues in our code, ensure consistency and reduce possibilities of bugs. They generally concern themselves with code **logic**.

Then we have [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is an **opinionated code formatter**. It concerns itself more with code **style** - things like line length, indentation, syntax, etc. Prettier's main job is to ensure consistency in code, no matter the development enviornment or the number of people working on the same file.

Regardless of whether a project is using Tailwind or not, ESLint and Prettier are both tools that should be part of our workflow. A lot of what we do as part of code authoring process can be automated away with these tools, and help reduce the cognitive load while writing code. With Tailwind, this is particularly noticeable.

Both ESLint and Prettier have an extensive 3rd party plugins ecosystem. There are plugins and shared configurations available for all sorts of use cases, enabling us to extend the base functionality of these tools. Frameworks and libraries often provide plugins that are meant to work seamlessly alongside them, whether official or developed by the open-source community, and Tailwind is no exception.

## Setup

### Installation

First, let's install the necessary libraries.

In addition to core [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) packages themselves, there are two main plugins that we'll need:

- [eslint-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss) for **ESLint**
- [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for **Prettier**

Install these as dev dependencies:

```sh
npm install -D eslint eslint-plugin-tailwindcss prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

### Configuration

Next, we need to create config files for both ESLint and Prettier.

#### ESLint

First, let's do **ESLint**. Create an `.eslintrc` file at the root of your project:

```json filename=".eslintrc"
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended",
    "plugin:tailwindcss/recommended"
  ],
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2021,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "plugins": ["tailwindcss"]
}
```

Here we're extending the recommended rule sets from ESLint, Prettier, and the Tailwind CSS plugin, as well as specifying `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` itself to be used as a plugin. We're also setting some defaults for our project environment and parser options.

> **NOTE:** This is the most basic setup. It's highly recommended to look into the [advanced configuration options](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/) for ESLint, and take the time to setup additional plugins and options appropriate for your project environment.

#### Prettier

For **Prettier**, we'll stick with most of the defaults, overriding just a couple of options. Create a `.prettierrc` file:

```json filename=".prettierrc"
{
  "printWidth": 90,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

These are personal preferences - see the complete list of [options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) and adjust as needed.

One neat thing with Prettier is that you don't need to explicitly list the plugins that you'd like to use. So long as they're in the same `node_modules` folder as Prettier itself, they're [loaded automatically](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html#using-plugins). Since we installed everything in our project already, we're all set in that regard.

### Setting Up Scripts

Let's now create some scripts to help automate the linting process. In `package.json`, add a `lint` and `format` scripts. For demo purposes, let's assume all of our code is in `src` folder:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint --fix src",
    "format": "prettier --write src"
  }
}
```

The `lint` script will run **ESLint** on everything inside our `src` folder, and the `--fix` flag tells it to fix any automatically-fixable issues at the same time as well. This will use the config specified in the `.eslintrc` file we created earlier, including the plugins.

Similarly, the `format` script will run **Prettier** and format it using the options specified in `.prettierrc`. As mentioned earlier, Prettier loads its plugins automatically, so the Tailwind plugin will be loaded for us already.

For complete list of available CLI options, see [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html).

### Using Scripts

With our scripts defined, we can now run these as part of our workflow to lint and format our code.

To test it out, run `npm run lint`. Here's a real example from my personal site that I ran into recently:

<ImageCard
  src="/blog/tailwind-eslint-prettier/tailwind-eslint-output.png"
  alt="Example of output from ESLint"
/>

As you can see, **eslint-plugin-tailwindcss** helped identify some deprecated classes that I was still using. Neat! I'd been using Tailwind v3 for some time now, without realizing there were deprecated class names in my code. Without this plugin, there's a good chance I still wouldn't have noticed this.

Similarly, **prettier-plugin-tailwindcss** tells me that a number of Tailwind classes aren't sorted properly in a few places. Little while back, Tailwind team introduced [official class sorting](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted), which with the help of this plugin sorts classes in a specific order. This order essentially follows how Tailwind structures the classes in the final CSS output. Having them sorted the same way in the code helps to visualize the cascade, which IMO is extremely helpful.

### Pre-commit Hook

Running these scripts manually every time is not great. Let's fix that!

To help automate the process, we can use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to create a pre-commit hook that will run [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), which in turn will run these linting scripts on staged files, before committing them.

To do this, run the following command:

```bash
npx mrm@2 lint-staged
```

This does a few things:

- Installs `lint-staged` and `husky`
- Creates a pre-commit hook in the `.husky` directory which runs `lint-staged`
- Updates `package.json` with config for `lint-staged`

Notice the new entry in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"lint-staged": {
  "*.js": "eslint --cache --fix",
  "*.{js,css,md}": "prettier --write"
}
```

Let's update this to use our scripts instead:

```json filename="package.json"
"lint-staged": {
  "*.js": "npm run lint",
  "*.{js,css,md*}": "npm run format"
}
```

This will tell **lint-staged** to run our `lint` script on all staged JS files, and `format` on JS, CSS and MD(X) ones (as always, adjust this as needed). Now, before any code is committed, it's guaranteed to be linted and properly formatted. If either of those scripts fails, a commit will not proceed and we'll see what the issues are in the output:

## Integrating with VSCode

Now this is where it gets even better. If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), there are extensions that can help automate things further.

### Extensions

Install the following VSCode extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
- [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)(`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)(`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`)

The first two integrate **ESLint** and **Prettier** into VSCode, which will let VSCode underline any problematic code that is identified:

<ImageCard
  src="/blog/tailwind-eslint-prettier/tailwind-vscode-1.png"
  alt="Example of issues identified by ESLint Tailwind plugin"
/>

Hovering over the issue will show more details:

<ImageCard
  src="/blog/tailwind-eslint-prettier/tailwind-vscode-2.png"
  alt="Example of issues identified by ESLint Tailwind plugin"
/>

The **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension adds intellisense for Tailwind classes. This will let VSCode show suggestions for Tailwind classes, and what CSS they output. It even works with any custom classes you have defined in your Tailwind config. Very handy!

Now, as long as you have the `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` configuration files in your root, VSCode will highlight any applicable issues in your code, using the provided configurations.

If you'd like to take it a step further, you can also create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in your repo to provide a list of recommended extensions for anyone cloning it:

```json filename=".vscode/extensions.json"
{
  "recommendations": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss"
  ]
}
```

### Enabling auto-format on save

The last thing we want to do is enable automatic code formatting whenever we save a file in VSCode. This way, you let the tools worry about style and formatting, and can just focus on writing code.

<ImageCard
  src="/blog/tailwind-eslint-prettier/tailwind-prettier-vscode.gif"
  alt="Tailwind with ESLint and Prettier"
/>

First, open up your VSCode `settings.json` file: `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`. Make sure that the default formatter is set to the Prettier extension:

```json
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
```

Then, enable format on save:

```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true
```

Note that these settings can also be specified separately for specific languages:

```json filename="settings.json"
"[html, javascript]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

Now, whenever you save a file, **Prettier** will format it using the VSCode extension. This means that not only do you get all the nice formatting from Prettier config, but your Tailwind classes will also be in the same consistent order thanks to the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin.

## Shared Config

If you like this setup (and are using **React** and **Next.js**) - all of the plugins mentioned here (and a few others) are included in my personal shared config:

<WTFCard className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2">
  ✨ [ACME ESLint Config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-acme) ✨
</WTFCard>

These days **Next.js** and **Tailwind** are my default go-to's when building a new project, and I'll generally want the same rules applied throughout, including the same set of plugins. This [shareable config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/developer-guide/shareable-configs) makes it easy to use my preferred configuration, and not have to worry about setting up everything from scratch every time. Just install, extend, and you're good to go!

This particular config is based on the popular [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and extends the corresponding [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb), as well as few others that I always find myself using. Feel free to use it in your project as well!
