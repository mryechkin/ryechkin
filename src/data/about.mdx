I'm a software engineer based in <span className="whitespace-nowrap font-bold">Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</span>

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years now, with focus mainly on the front-end side of things. I originally studied Telecommunications (Electrical) Engineering, but my passion has always been in web development and its surrounding technologies.

Most recently, I've been working in [design systems](https://rangle.io/blog/what-is-a-design-system/) space, and building accessible component libraries in **React** and their tooling.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I oversee the React implementation of its global design system and the supporting ecosystem.

Some of my current favourite tech includes:
