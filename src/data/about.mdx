  Hey! I'm **Mykhaylo** - I'm a **UX Engineer**.

I live in <span className="whitespace-nowrap inline-flex items-center">Canada <img src="/assets/ca.svg" className="!my-0 ml-1 w-4 h-4" alt="Canada flag" /></span> but was born and raised in <span className="whitespace-nowrap inline-flex items-center">Kyiv, Ukraine <img src="/assets/ua.svg" className="!my-0 ml-1 w-4 h-4" alt="Ukraine flag" /></span>

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years, with focus mainly on the front-end side of things. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web technologies and UX.

Most recently, I've been working in [design systems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/) space, building accessible component libraries and the surrounding ecosystems.

In my role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at Manulife, I oversee the React implementation of its global design system - component library, documentation platform, and supplementary tooling.

Some of my current favourite tech includes:
