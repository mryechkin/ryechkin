  Hey! My name is **Mykhaylo**, and I'm a **Front-End Engineer** âœ¨ðŸš€
</div>

I live in <span className="whitespace-nowrap inline-flex items-center">Canada <img src="/assets/ca.svg" className="!my-0 ml-1 w-4 h-4" alt="Canada flag" /></span> but was born and raised in <span className="whitespace-nowrap inline-flex items-center">Ukraine <img src="/assets/ua.svg" className="!my-0 ml-1 w-4 h-4" alt="Ukraine flag" /></span>

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years, with focus mainly on the front end side of things. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web technologies and user experience.

Most recently, I've been working in [design systems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/) space, building accessible component libraries and their surrounding ecosystems.

In my current role as a **Lead Front-End Engineer** at Manulife, I oversee the React implementation of its global design system - component library, documentation platform, and supplementary tooling.

Some of my current favourite tech includes:
