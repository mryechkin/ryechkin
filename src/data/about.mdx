I live in <span className="whitespace-nowrap font-bold">Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</span> but was born and raised in <span className="whitespace-nowrap font-bold">Kyiv, Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</span>.

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years, with focus mainly on building UI's. I originally studied Telecommunications Engineering, but my passion has always been in web technologies and UX.

Most recently, I've been working in [design systems](https://rangle.io/blog/what-is-a-design-system/) space, building accessible component libraries and their ecosystems.

In my role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at Manulife, I oversee the React implementation of its global design system: component library, documentation platform, and supplementary tooling.

Some of my current favourite tech includes:
