I'm a software engineer based in <span className="whitespace-nowrap font-bold">Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</span>

I've been doing web development for over {experience} years now, with focus mainly on **front-end** web technologies. I originally studied Telecommunications (Electrical) Engineering, but my passion has always been in web development and its surrounding tech.

Most recently, I've been focusing on [design systems](https://rangle.io/blog/what-is-a-design-system/) space and building accessible component libraries in **React**.

In my current role as a **Lead Software Engineer** at **Manulife**, I oversee the React implementation of its global **design system**.

Some of my current favourite tech includes:
